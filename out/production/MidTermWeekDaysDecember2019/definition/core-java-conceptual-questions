Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

  For example, you can write and compile a Java program on UNIX and run it on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX machine without any modifications to the source code. WORA is achieved by compiling a Java program into an intermediate language called bytecode. The format of bytecode is platform-independent. A virtual machine, called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), is used to run the bytecode on each platform.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.





What is IDE?
A.An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?

Q.Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.You cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class (interface is not even considered as a class.) What you can do is to implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract.

Q.what is Access Specifier?
A.Specifiers are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.

Q.What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.Definition of OOP Concepts in Java
 They are an abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Grasping them is key to understanding how Java works.

Q.What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A.The packages available by default in Java include :
  The java. lang package is imported implicitly, which contains a number of components that are used very commonly in Java programs like for primitive types. Java is useless without much of the functionality in java. lang

Q.What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.(Application Programming Interface)
 -Google
 - Drive
 -youTube
 -buffer


Q.Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.java does not support multiple inheritances through classes but through the interfaces, we can use multiple inheritances.

Q.What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different. It is similar to constructor overloading in Java.

Q.Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A.An exception object is an instance of an exception class. It gets created and handed to the Java runtime when an exceptional event occurred that disrupted the normal flow of the application.

Q.What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.
Q.What is final and how it has been used variables a????/
A.

Q.What is final, finally and finalize?
A.Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected. 2) Final is a keyword.

Q.What is a constructor ?
A.A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object.

Q.Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.YES a class can have multiple constructors.

Q.If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.

Q.What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.Keyword THIS is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object. ... It can be used to refer instance variable of current class. It can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor. It can be passed as an argument in the method.

Q.What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.Super is a keyword. It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class.

Q.How java manage it's memory?
A.Before Java, all program memory was managed by the programmer. In Java, program memory is managed by the JVM. The JVM manages memory through a process called garbage collection, which continuously identifies and eliminates unused memory in Java programs. Garbage collection happens inside a running JVM.

Q.What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

Q.Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Q.Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection
